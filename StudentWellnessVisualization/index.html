                We are exploring the problems students face in their everyday lives that elicit stress and anxiety, as well as their experiences and strategies of dealing with these problems. We are also looking into the mental health support that is currently offered
                to students on the Ohio State University(OSU)'s campus<br /><br /> We will use the result of this research project to design a supportive community that promotes positive thinking and positive behavaiors in the future.
                We will do so by <a href="#codesign">co-deisgning</a> with OSU students and mental health providers. We call this project <b>Design for the Pursuit of Happiness</b>.<br />

                        Co-design brings the people who will be served by design directly into the prcess as participants. In <b>Design for the Pursuit of Happiness</b>,OSU students and mental health providers whill be he co-designers. Co-design acknowledges
                        that everyone who is affected by (the students) or who uses (the providers) what is designed should play a central role in the design process.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> We conducted three co-design sessions with a total of 23 participants. Participants are undergraduate studentd of different levels (freshmen to seniors) and majors at The Ohio State University(Figure top). Then we organize
                        and analyze the different types of data from co-design in order to identify the emerging patterns(Figure bottom).
                        <br/>
                        <br/> In a co-design process, designers create different toolkits for non-designers to use to express themselves creatively. in our co-design session with students, we designed toolkits based on quantifiable charts and diagrams
                        for the purpose of answering these <a href="#questions">research questions</a>.
