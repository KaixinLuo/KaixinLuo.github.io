                We are exploring the problems students face in their everyday lives that elicit stress and anxiety, as
                well as
                their experiences and strategies of dealing with these problems. We are also looking into the mental
                health
                support that is currently offered to students on the Ohio State University(OSU)'s campus<br /><br />
                We will use the result of this research project to design a supportive community that promotes positive
                thinking
                and positive behavaiors in the future. We will do so by <a href="#codesign">co-deisgning</a> with OSU
                students and
                mental health
                providers. We call this project <b>Design for the Pursuit of Happiness</b>.<br />
